Quick install guide
===================

The easiest way to install Roll Your Own is to use use ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` you have have them installed. If that's the case, use one of the following commands::

    pip install rollyourown
    easy_install rollyourown

If you don't have ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` installed, you will need to do things manually. 
Firstly, install Django by following the installation instructions at http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/.  
Next download the RollYourOwn release from http://code.google.com/p/rollyourown/. To unpack and install it, run the following from your shell::

    tar xvzf rollyourown-1.0.tar.gz
    cd rollyourown-1.0/
    python setup.py install

That's it, you've installed everything you need to install. You can now try the :ref:`tutorial <introduction-commerce-tutorial>`.
